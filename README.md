## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools
- Windows 10/11 SDK
- Git for version control

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neumont-gamedev/GAT150.git
   cd GAT150
   ```

2. **Initialize third-party libraries**
   - SDL3, Box2D, and FMOD libraries should be included in the ThirdParty directory
   - Copy required DLL files to the Build directory

3. **Open in Visual Studio**
   - Open `GAT150.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
   - Set the build configuration to Debug or Release
   - Set the platform to x64

4. **Build and Run**
   - Build the entire solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   - Set the Game project as the startup project
   - Run the application (F5)

### Configuration

The engine uses JSON files for configuration:

```json
{
  "window": {
    "title": "GAT150 Game Engine",
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "fullscreen": false
  },
  "physics": {
    "gravity": [0, -9.8],
    "timeStep": 0.016667
  }
}
```

## üéÆ Usage Example

```cpp
#include "Engine.h"

class MyGame : public Game {
public:
    void Initialize() override {
        // Create game objects
        auto player = CreateGameObject("Player");
        player->AddComponent<SpriteRenderer>("player.png");
        player->AddComponent<RigidBody>(RigidBody::BodyType::Dynamic);
        player->AddComponent<BoxCollider>(Vector2{32, 32});
    }
    
    void Update(float deltaTime) override {
        // Game logic updates
        HandleInput();
        UpdateGameObjects(deltaTime);
    }
};

int main() {
    Engine engine;
    MyGame game;
    
    engine.Initialize();
    engine.Run(&game);
    engine.Shutdown();
    
    return 0;
}
```
